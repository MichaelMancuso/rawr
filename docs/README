RAWR is designed to make the process of web enumeration easy and efficient by providing pertinent information in usable formats.
It uses NMap(live or from file), Metasploit, Qualys, Nexpose, or Nessus scan data to target web services for enumeration, then visits
each host on each port with an identified web service and gathers as much data as possible.
