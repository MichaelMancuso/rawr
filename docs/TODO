ToDo
	KNOWN ISSUES
		program control
			possible solution - change queue items to individual tasks rather than one host
			sometimes threads hang until ctrl+c - not sure why/where just yet.
			need a better timeout mechanism for spider and diagram creation
			reduce hard-limit for # of links in diagram
			PAUSE functionality (in-program)
			STOP file (for resuming scans)
			Ctrl+C 'graceful stop' effectiveness
		html result to thumbnail matchup issues when scanning external websites w/ multiple handles (IP, hn, port)		

	CLEANUP/OPTIMIZATION
		remove response object from target - give the option to keep it
		remove large/unneeded items from target before insertion into db
		functions.py
			SiThread
			parsedata - initial cleanup
			crawl
			parse_qualys_scan_report_xml - initial cleanup
			parse_nessus_xml - initial cleanup
			parse_nmap_xml - initial cleanup

	FUNCTIONALITY
		improve meta detection
			file props
			filetypes to figure out: .pdf .pps .wpd

			parse:  .doc .ppt .xls .odf* .sxw .svg .sxc .sxi
					def parse_file(content):
						# use lxml to parse these!

			unzip: .docx .pptx .ppsx .xlsx .odf* .svgz

		accept --useragent csv input
		create password lists for each site - (meta + content + defpass info) across the whole crawl
		implement curses interface
		smarter redirects
			if res.status_code == 302 and not domainname in res.get_redirect_location:
				target['redir_loc'] = res.get_redirect_location
			else: follow redirect!
			target['history'] to record all redirect urls
		implement spider_url_hit_limit
		
	FUTURE
		change '-b' to '-dns'
			use bing for external IPs and attempt DNS AXFR on any DNS servers found
				cache results just like bing requests
				https://github.com/lijiejie/DNS_AXFR_Client
				add port 53 to nmap scan if applicable
				check local system DNS
				use nslookup to find authoritative DNS, query it
		stats page in HTML report
        	first line in HTML data
        	stats ideas: server version, SSL, ports, service (PHP, ASP.NET)
		scan comparison functionality
			compare two scans within one db
			compare a db scan with new scan
			'diff' HTML report
